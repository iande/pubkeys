# My GPG Public Keys

## ian.eccles@gmail.com.asc

As the name suggests, I use this key for signing/decrypting emails.  I also
use it to sign tags in my public git repositories.

This guy's tends to get used on my laptop and doesn't tend to venture out
into the public eye on its own.  I only include it here because I sign my
other keys with it.
